## Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install
the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll
server.
I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/)
page on Jekyll's website.
